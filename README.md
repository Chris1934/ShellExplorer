# ShellExplorer

**ShellExplorer** is an *Shell Script based File Manager* for bash supporting Linux Distributions.

*`Using sh Script`*
To start using this, you have to download any Version. Then you can easily start it by write following into your terminal:

`'bash /directory/ShellExplorer##.#.sh'`

The directory must be replaced by the folder where you put in the  file and the # by the version (e. g. 20.1). Then it will start.

*`Using deb Package:`*
You yust have to download one of the deb Packages and install it graphical.
If you have no Desktop you can type in `'sudo dpkg -i /directory/ShellExplorer##.#.deb'`
Also here you have to replace /'directory' with the folder, where you put the Package in and the '##.#' with the version.
If it's installed you can run it by typing in `'bash /usr/share/shellexplorer/shellexplorer.sh'` and it will start.
