# ShellExplorer

**ShellExplorer** is an *Shell Script based File Manager* for bash supporting Linux Distributions.

To start using this, you have to download any Version. Then you can easily start it by write following into your terminal:

`'bash /directory/ShellExplorer##.#.sh`'

The directory must be replaced by the folder where you put in the  file and the # by the version (e. g. 20.1). Then it will start.
